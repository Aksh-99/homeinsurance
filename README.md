# Project Overview

This project aims to predict which clients are more likely to remove or resiliate their insurance policy. We will be using a dataset that contains various features about the clients and their policies.

## Data Preprocessing

We will start with data preprocessing, which includes handling missing values, and transforming categorical variables into a format that can be used by machine learning models. We will also explore the data to understand the relationships between different variables.

## Machine Learning Models

We will then build and evaluate several machine learning models, including:
- Linear Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Extreme Boost (XGBoost)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Network

Each model will be evaluated using metrics such as Error Matrix, ROC curves, and Area Under the Precision-Recall (PR) curve. The goal is to select the best model for predicting client resiliation.

## Pearson Correlation

We will also conduct a Pearson correlation analysis to understand the relationships between different variables in the dataset. This will help us identify any potential multicollinearity issues and understand the importance of different features in predicting the target variable.

# Tools Used

- Rattle: A graphical user interface for data science in R, used for building machine learning models and conducting data analysis.
- Imgbb: A website used for uploading images that will be included in the notebook.

# Usage

To use this project, you will need to have R and Rattle installed on your computer. The dataset should be loaded into R, and then you can use the Rattle interface to preprocess the data and build machine learning models. The results of the models, along with any images, can be uploaded to Imgbb and included in the notebook.

# Conclusion

This project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the process of building and evaluating machine learning models for predicting client resiliation in the insurance industry. We hope that this notebook will provide valuable insights and serve as a useful resource for anyone interested in this topic.
